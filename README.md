|[Amazon Pick List Excel Sheet](Amazon%20Pick%20List.xlsx)|I worked at an Amazon warehouse for 9 months in 2016, and was promoted to an assistant supervisor (ambassador) partway though. This Excel sheet was created by another Amazon employee to keep track of worker performance, but I took over and gradually improved it with new functionality such as highlighting and average time calculations, error-handling, and bug fixes.<br><br>If Excel shows an error about circular references, you'll need to enable iterative calculation in File, Options, Formulas.<br><br>Credit for Column BN's formula goes to [Tony Valko](https://www.excelforum.com/excel-formulas-and-functions/1138435-collect-unique-values-from-area.html#post4381995).|[![Amazon Pick List](https://i.imgur.com/gkFePxK_d.jpg?maxwidth=520&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)](https://i.imgur.com/gkFePxK.png)|
|[Amazon Sortation Tracker Excel Sheet](Amazon%20Sortation%20Tracker.xlsx)|I created this file as an additional way to help analyze worker metrics. Workers who received routes with a disproportionately higher number of packages would unfairly appear to be working slower, but this sheet would show the actual number of packages they sorted. Our internal tool only showed data for the last 4 hours, and sometimes had multiple entries for the same worker, which is why Excel had to be used to collate and process a full day's worth of data.<br><br>Nowadays, I'd be more reluctant to focus on performance metrics, given Amazon's reputation, but I still tried to be more empathetic than the other supervisors..|[![Amazon Sortation Tracker](https://i.imgur.com/hrBRWrW_d.jpg?maxwidth=520&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)](https://i.imgur.com/hrBRWrW.png)|
|[Amazon Attendance Comp Excel Sheet](Amazon%20Attendance%20Comp.xlsx)|My warehouse wanted to use Excel for a competition in December to reward workers with the highest attendance. I created this file, but since I would be leaving in December, I made the sheet more robust than usual with notices of potential errors to fix, and manually written aliases for common typos of worker names. (Since these files no longer use real worker names, the original list of 50+ aliases has been replaced with a much shorter example list.)<br><br>This sheet also requires iterative calculation to be enabled.|[![Amazon Attendance Comp](https://i.imgur.com/qJLhlsk_d.jpg?maxwidth=520&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)](https://i.imgur.com/qJLhlsk.png)|
|[MvM Power Palooza](mvm_meltdown_rc5_int_power_palooza.pop)|[Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) is a video game made by Valve. Most gamemodes in TF2 are two teams of players competing against each other, but [Mann vs. Machine](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_vs._Machine) is a co-operative gamemode where 6 players defend their base from waves of pre-determined robots. It is possible to create both custom maps (the world geometry) and custom missions (the order and makeup of the robots).<br><br>In 2021, I created a custom mission for [Operation Starched Silliness](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Operation_Starched_Silliness), an April Fool's community MvM charity campaign. The campaign used [rafmod](https://github.com/rafradek/sigsegv-mvm), which extends the population file syntax for additional features and allows spawning and manipulation of entities. The missions usually are a mix of memes/jokes and silly mechanics that subvert normal gameplay, but my mission focused on the latter. More info can be found on my [GameBanana submission](https://gamebanana.com/mods/284057).|[![Power Palooza](https://i.imgur.com/alHgKfV.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDXvUwtM-6g)|
|[MvM Jackpot](mvm_meltdown_rc5_int_power_palooza.pop)|Also in 2021, I made a mission for [Operation Binary Blackout](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Operation_Binary_Blackout), another community MvM charity campaign. These missions are "vanilla", not using rafmod. Despite this, my mission still manipulates map entities in a way that's very rarely seen in other vanilla missions. My GameBanana submission and Youtube video aren't ready yet though.|[![Jackpot](https://i.imgur.com/LPCYi9r_d.jpg?maxwidth=520&shape=thumb&fidelity=high)](https://i.imgur.com/LPCYi9r.png)|
